Hello, this is **Eliseu Lucena Barros**

I'm a passionate **software developer** living in **Fortaleza, Brazil**. I love being part of development of Back-end technologies. I like to **organize conferences and give talks**.
I love **open source development** and **functional programming**, I build things on my GitHub profile (here).
I love **C programming** and **Odin programming language** (which is similar to Go and C/C++).
I have over **6 years of professional** experience with **programming**.

The past inspires me http://worrydream.com/dbx/

- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning Golang and Erlang
- üëØ I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on Open-Source Projects
- ü§î I‚Äôm looking to help with any technical step in the process of software-making
- üí¨ Ask me about my computer setup with [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) (heheheh)
- üì´ How to reach me: https://www.linkedin.com/in/eliseulucenabarros-3333/
- üéì A updated version of my EUROPASS CV: [CV](https://github.com/haller33/haller33/blob/main/CV.pdf)
- ‚ö° Fun fact: I'm still playing Portal 2

Do not forget to view my open source projects below üëáüèª

[typewriter-song](https://github.com/haller33/typewriter-song) - Using the eBPF framework(linux kernel bytecode 'interface', with bpftrace) with a websocket on C to do typewriter strokes on the keyboard, has been a consequence of learning/searching the DTrace tracking system stuff on the OpenIndiana/OpenSolaris Operating System.

[Kernel Patch (RR Schedule)](https://gist.github.com/haller33/c0e3dd2732050098886cf2fb1da540a6) - Over 6 months searching for a Kernel patch with found problems on load-average on my Linux system, trying all sort of things to solve, and finally changed the default kernel scheduler to minimize my problem of playing games and freezing/high CPU usage

[dequeued_language](https://github.com/haller33/dequeued_language) - A Double queue ring buffer-based language, inspired by Porth (a asm clone of Forth) to deal with playing ideas of a old custom-made language implemented by myself on Haskell and try to see what we can achieve with concurrency paradigm and distributed / RPC (future!) on this little toy language with the core have been created on little sort of a week.

[spawn-rune](https://github.com/haller33/spawn-rune) - A 24h/weekend project that take solve the pain of my Mate Desktop usage and create a bloat free launcher of programs using Odin and Raylib, a marathon which also have C bindings for a custom tiny C library of my own for this project.

[csv-parser-c](https://github.com/haller33/csv-parser-c) - A pure C, tiny, bloat-free, leak-free CSV parser, using only STB-style libraries and custom allocators to have memory management and streaming capabilities to read CSV files from disk, is a portable drop and using library, can be just included and used on C/C++ projects!

[dama-odin](https://github.com/haller33/dama-odin) - A Checkers Game made with Odin using Raylib library binds that creates a board for playing the game with a custom debug system and handmade interface, inspired by the idea of immediate mode interfaces and good usage of resources from Data Oriented Design capabilities on the Odin programming language.
